# Employee Management Dashboard (React.js)

## Project Overview

The **Employee Management Dashboard** is a frontend-only React application that allows users to manage employee records efficiently.  
It includes authentication, employee CRUD operations, search & filtering, status management, and printing features — all implemented using modern UI/UX principles.
